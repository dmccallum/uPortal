## This file is intentionally empty except for comments. ##

# Historically, this file served as a set of default property values to be applied
# to SSP-Platform/uPortal configuration at build time. All those defaults have
# since been moved to ..//uportal-war/src/main/resources/properties/ssp-platform-config.default.properties
# and **are evaluated at runtime, not during the build**. This means, for example, that
# you can change the database account credentials without rebuilding from source.

# If you have modified this file locally or are maintaining sibling, environment-specific
# files, e.g. dev.properties, prod.properties, etc, you should move that configuration
# into ${SSP_CONFIGDIR}/ssp-platform-config.properties and maintain it using whatever
# SCM/backup solution you're already using for that directory.

# In some cases it may still be necessary to set configuration at buildtime using
# this or sibling files. The most notable case is for property placeholders added
# to ../uportal-war/src/main/resources/properties/groups/PAGSGroupStoreConfig.xml.
# That file does not define Spring managed resources and the component that
# interprets it does not attempt to resolve property placeholders (e.g. ${foo}).
# That file does not contain any property placeholders by default, though. So this
# caveat does not apply unless you have customized it.

# NB: There has been no change to the way files are selected for property placeholder
# filtering at build time. Files with filter tokens MUST be listed in the <includes>
# section for filtering in the appropriate  pom.xml file. Also... use 'filters.file'
# to override the location of the properties file for Maven filtering. The specified
# location should be a RELATIVE PATH. If not specified, this file (build.properties or
# build.{env}.properties) will be used.
