# Properties that reflect the build itself. They serve roughly the same purpose as
# the properties added to MANIFEST.MF in the SSP build. As such these properties
# are typically dereferenced by the build rather than at runtime. In fact, since
# SSP-1888 this is the only file eligible for build time property placeholder
# filtering by default.
#
# These properties *are* available to runtime property placeholder dereferencing,
# though.
