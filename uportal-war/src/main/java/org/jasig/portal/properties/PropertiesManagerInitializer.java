/**
 * Ensures that {@link PropertiesManager} is initialized before the Spring {@code BeanFactory} actually starts
 * instantiating "normal" singletons. This is important because some beans will attempt to access static methods on
 * that class during their own initialization process, but that class is not ever instantiated as a Spring bean,
 * nor do dependent classes declared their dependency on it via Spring config. So this was the least intrusive
 * way of ensuring a fully initialized {@link PropertiesManager} would be available when Spring started
 * instantiating singletons.
 *
 * <p>Using this class represents a significant departure from pre-SSP-1888 behavior in that for any given
 * {@code portal.properties} property, you get get the same value from either a {@link PropertiesManager} lookup, or
 * a property placeholder-style reference from a Spring Bean definition. Previously the latter would participate in
 * embedded property placeholder resolution but the former would not.</p>
